Boosters are also recommeneded for those between the ages of 12 and 17 if they are at a higher risk of infection.

Pregnant people are at a higher risk of complications due to COVID-19 infection and therefore are highly encouraged to get a booster dose. Those that are immunocompromised should also get a booster dose 6 months after their initial primary dose series.
